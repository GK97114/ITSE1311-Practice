                  Went with my wife and in-laws: had a great time and I got a gyro plate as per reccomendation from the owner. It was great but it took 			a while to prepare our meal. We also had to wait a while to get a place to seat, and was not the most comfortable chair nor did it 				help that the table was terribly wobbly.

                  It was an OK place to eat. The atmosphere was a little rowdy but the food was admittedly great. Wish there was better seating 				arangements: we sat next to the bathrooms...
